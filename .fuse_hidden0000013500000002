The autocorrelation of Data2 shows peaks of smaller values
also the highest second peak will be found in a smaller sample number compared to the Data1, this indicates a faster heart rate.
so as we can see the faster the heart rate, the smaller the index of the highest second peak in the autocorrelation in the ECG is.
